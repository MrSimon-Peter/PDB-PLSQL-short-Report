##1. Overview of Tasks
###Task 1: Create a New Pluggable Database (PDB)
I created a new PDB named 'si_pdb_27955' using SQL*Plus while connected as SYSDBA. The admin user was created as 'simonpierre_plsqlauca_27955' with a simple password. After creation, I opened and saved the PDB state to make it automatically open each time the database starts.
