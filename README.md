**Name:** Mukiza Simonpierre  
**Student ID:** 27955  
**Course:** PLSQL  
**Task:** Working with Pluggable Databases (PDBs)
## 1. Overview of Tasks
### Task 1: Create a New Pluggable Database (PDB)
I created a new PDB named 'si_pdb_27955' using SQL*Plus while connected as SYSDBA. The admin user was created as 'simonpierre_plsqlauca_27955' with a simple password. After creation, I opened and saved the PDB state to make it automatically open each time the database starts.
### Task 2: Create and Delete a PDB
I created another PDB named 'si_to_delete_pdb_27955' for practice. After confirming its creation and opening it, I closed and deleted it using the DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE command.
### Task 3: Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)
After completing both PDB tasks, I accessed Oracle Enterprise Manager to monitor the database. I captured a screenshot of the dashboard showing my username and PDB details.
